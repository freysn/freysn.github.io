abstract="We propose a novel technique for the automatic, similarity-based selection of representative surfaces. While our technique can be applied to any set of manifolds, we particularly focus on isosurfaces from volume data. We select representatives from sets of surfaces stemming from varying isovalues or time-dependent data. For selection, our approach interpolates between surfaces using a minimum cost flow solver, and determines whether the interpolate adequately represents the actual surface in-between. For this, we employ the Hausdorff distance as an intuitive measure of the similarity of two components. In contrast to popular contour tree-based approaches which are limited to changes inÂ topology, our approach also accounts for geometric deviations. For interactive visualization, we employ a combination of surface renderings and a graph view that depicts the selected surfaces and their relation. We finally demonstrate the applicability and utility of our approach by means of several data sets from different areas.",
