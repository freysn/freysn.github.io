ABSTRACT = {Increasingly fast computing systems for simulations and high-accuracy measurement techniques drive the generation of time-dependent volumetric data sets with high resolution in both time and space. To gain insights from this spatio-temporal data, the computation and direct visualization of pairwise distances between time steps not only supports interactive user exploration, but also drives automatic analysis techniques like the generation of a meaningful static overview visualization, the identification of rare events, or the visual analysis of recurrent processes. However, the computation of pairwise differences between all time steps is prohibitively expensive for large-scale data not only due to the significant cost of computing expressive distance between high-resolution spatial data, but in particular owing to the large number of distance computations     ( O ( | T  | 2  ) )    , with     | T |     being the number of time steps). Addressing this issue, we present and evaluate different strategies for the progressive computation of similarity information in a time series, as well as an approach for estimating distance information that has not been determined so far. In particular, we investigate and analyze the utility of using neural networks for estimating pairwise distances. On this basis, our approach automatically determines the sampling strategy yielding the best result in combination with trained networks for estimation. We evaluate our approach with a variety of time-dependent 2D and 3D data from simulations and measurements as well as artificially generated data, and compare it against an alternative technique. Finally, we discuss prospects and limitations, and discuss different directions for improvement in future work.},
